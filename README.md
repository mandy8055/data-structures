# data-structures

A comprehensive collection of generic data structure implementations which are not supported natively by the for TypeScript/JavaScript, and published on JSR.

## Installation

```typescript
import {
  LinkedList,
  DoublyLinkedList,
  Deque,
  Queue,
  MinHeap,
  MaxHeap,
  Trie,
  PriorityQueue,
  SortedMap,
  RedBlackTree,
  BiDirectionalMap,
  LRUCache,
} from 'jsr:@mskr/data-structures';
// or if you want to use it with esm.sh
// import * as ds from 'https://esm.sh/jsr/@mskr/data-structures';
// import { ... } from 'https://esm.sh/jsr/@mskr/data-structures';
```

## Available Data Structures and their detailed documentations

- [LinkedList](./docs/linked-list.md): Singly linked list implementation
- [DoublyLinkedList](./docs/doubly-linked-list.md): Doubly linked list with bidirectional traversal
- [Deque](./docs/deque.md): For efficient support of insertion and removal of elements from both ends.
- [Queue](./docs/queue.md): A First-In-First-Out (FIFO) queue implementation that efficiently supports insertion at the back and removal from the front.
- [Trie](./docs/trie.md): For efficient storage and retrieval of strings while supporting associated values.
- [Binary Heap](./docs/binary-heap.md): Binary heap implementation that provides both Min Heap and Max Heap variants with efficient operations.
- [PriorityQueue](./docs/priority-queue.md): Implementation backed by a binary heap, where elements are dequeued based on their priority.
- [RedBlackTree](./docs/red-black-tree.md): Implementation providing self-balancing binary search tree operations
- [SortedMap](./docs/sorted-map.md): A generic key-value map that maintains its entries sorted by key using a Red-Black Tree.
- [BiDirectional Map](./docs/bi-map.md): maintains one-to-one mappings between two sets of elements. Each key maps to a unique value, and each value maps to a unique key.
- [LRU Cache](./docs/lru-cache.md): implementation that provides efficient O(1) operations for both accessing and storing elements, with automatic eviction of least recently used items when capacity is reached.

## Error Handling

The library includes custom error types:

- `EmptyStructureError`: For operations on empty structures
- `IndexOutOfBoundsError`: For invalid index access
- `InvalidOperationsError`: For performing invalid operations
